This paper aims to examine under what circumstances we can conclude the machine is actually thinking. At the beginning, the author clarified that difference between weak AI and strong AI. A week AI would be a very powerful tools to the study of mind, while a strong AI would be a mind that has cognitive states.
In Schank’s research, a machine is said to understand the story by provide appropriate answer. The writer pose objections on these statements by giving a counter example. It is the Chinese room example, where given a set of translate rule, a non-Chinese speaker could still give reasonable answers to questions about a text in Chinese by following these rules. In this thought experiment, the non-Chinese speaker is equivalent to the machine that could provide appropriate answers to question. It is shown that such machine would not be helpful in understanding mind because such process requires no actual understanding. Though the writer do not believe such machine shows the true mechanism of understanding, the comparison of the Chinese room and the English version of it definitely reveal some of the understanding process to us.
The writer also clarify what it means by “understanding”. It is not crucial for decision making but it is essential for a mind. The rest of this paper is answering questions. A system theory argues that the complete process and data this translator carried out is in fact understanding. The writer replies to this by arguing even if the translator internalized all the data and process, it would still not have understanding of those Chinese Characters means. Also, the writer points out the system is not actually understanding because this translate system could let to a complete absurd output base on absurd input. A person who actually understands could eliminate such possibility.
